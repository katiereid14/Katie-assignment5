# Import Data
```{r}
assignment5 = read_csv("assignment5_data.csv")
```

# Subject Level Means
```{r}
subject_accuracy = assignment5 %>%
  select(subject, prime_condition, accuracy)

subject_rt = assignment5 %>%
  select(subject, prime_condition, response_RT)
```

# Format of the Data
Both subject_accuracy and subject_rt are in long format because they both have multiple rows for each observation (each subject has multiple rows for the different conditions).

# Long to Wide Format
```{r}
subject_accuracy_wide = subject_accuracy %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = prime_condition, values_from = accuracy)
```
